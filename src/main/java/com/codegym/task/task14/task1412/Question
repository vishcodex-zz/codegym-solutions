/*

1. Write an implementation of the printMainInfo method:
1.1. If a Drawable object is passed to the method, call the draw method on the object.
1.2. If a Movable object is passed to the method, call the move method on the object.

Requirements:
The Solution class must implement a printMainInfo method with one Object parameter.
The printMainInfo method must be static.
The printMainInfo method must have the widest level of access (public).
The printMainInfo method must call the draw method on the passed object if the object implements the Drawable interface.
The printMainInfo method must call the move method on the passed object if the object implements the Movable interface.
