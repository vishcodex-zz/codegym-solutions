1. Think about how CanSwim and CanWalk interfaces relate to the SeaCreature class.
2. Create the correct inheritance relationship between the interfaces and the SeaCreature class.
3. Think about how the Orca, Whale, and RiverOtter classes might relate to the SeaCreature class.
4. Create the correct inheritance relationship between the Orca, Whale, and RiverOtter classes and the SeaCreature class.

Requirements:
An orca is a sea creature (descendant of SeaCreature) and can swim (supports the CanSwim interface).
A whale is a sea creature (descendant of SeaCreature) and can swim (supports the CanSwim interface).
The RiverOtter can walk (supports the CanWalk interface) and swim (supports the CanSwim interface).
A river otter is NOT a sea creature (descendant of SeaCreature).
Whales and orcas do NOT know how to walk (do not support the CanWalk interface).
