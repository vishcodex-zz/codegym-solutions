Read from the console to extend the functionality by analogy:
1. Figure out what the program does.
2. All classes must be inside the Solution class.
3. Add Cartoon and Thriller classes.
4. Understand how we get a SoapOpera object using the key "soapOpera".

Following the pattern used to obtain a SoapOpera object:
5. Add to MovieFactory.getMovie the ability to get a Cartoon object using the key "cartoon".
6. Add to MovieFactory.getMovie the ability to get a Thriller object using the key "thriller".
7. Read several keys (strings) from the console.
7.1. Stop reading in strings as soon as a string is entered that does not match one of the following: "cartoon", "thriller", "soapOpera".
8. Create a Movie movie variable, and for each entered string (key):
8.1. Get an object using MovieFactory.getMovie and assign it to the variable movie.
8.2. Display the result of calling movie.getClass().getSimpleName().

Requirements:
•	The Cartoon and Thriller classes must be static and be located inside the Solution class.
•	The MovieFactory.getMovie method must return a Cartoon object if "cartoon" is passed as an argument.
•	The MovieFactory.getMovie method must return a Thriller object if "thriller" is passed as an argument.
•	The main method must read strings from the keyboard.
•	The main method should stop reading strings from the keyboard if an invalid string is entered (i.e. something other than "cartoon", "thriller", or "soapOpera").
•	For each string entered (including the invalid string), you must call the MovieFactory.getMovie method.
•	For each valid string entered, you need to display the simple name (movie.getClass().getSimpleName()) of the object types returned by the MovieFactory.getMovie method.
