        1.Create an abstract Drink class with an implemented public void taste() method that displays "Delicious".
        2. Create a Wine class that inherits Drink and implements a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "Birthday".
        3. Create a BubblyWine class that inherits Wine and implements a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "New Year's".
        4. Write implementations for the getDeliciousDrink, getWine, and getBubblyWine methods.
        5. All the classes must be in separate files.

        •	The Drink class must implement a public void taste() method that displays "Delicious".
        •	The Wine class must be in a separate file and be a descendant of the Drink class.
        •	The Wine class must implement a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "Birthday".
        •	The BubblyWine class must be in a separate file and be a descendant of the Wine class.
        •	The BubblyWine class must implement a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "New Year's".
        •	The Solution class must implement the getDeliciousDrink() method, which returns a Wine object.
